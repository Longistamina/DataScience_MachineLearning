CONVEX SET:
A set C ⊆ ℝⁿ is convex if for all x, y ∈ C and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1:
    θx + (1-θ)y ∈ C

CONVEX FUNCTION:
A function f: ℝⁿ → ℝ is convex if its domain is a convex set and 
for all x, y ∈ dom f and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1:
    f(θx + (1-θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1-θ)f(y)

OPERATIONS PRESERVING CONVEXITY FOR SETS
================================================================================

1. INTERSECTION
   Property: The intersection of any collection of convex sets is convex
   Formula: If Cᵢ are convex for i ∈ I, then ∩ᵢ∈I Cᵢ is convex
   
   Examples:
   • Intersection of half-spaces: {x | aᵀx ≤ b₁} ∩ {x | cᵀx ≤ b₂}
   • Polytopes as intersections of half-spaces
   • Solution sets of linear inequalities
   • Feasible regions in linear programming

2. AFFINE TRANSFORMATIONS
   Property: Both images and preimages under affine transformations preserve convexity
   
   Forward transformation: If S is convex and f(x) = Ax + b, then
   f(S) = {Ax + b | x ∈ S} is convex
   
   Inverse transformation: If T is convex and f(x) = Ax + b, then
   f⁻¹(T) = {x | Ax + b ∈ T} is convex
   
   Examples:
   • Scaling: {ax | x ∈ C} for scalar a
   • Translation: {x + b | x ∈ C} for vector b
   • Rotation and reflection of convex sets
   • Linear transformations of ellipsoids remain ellipsoids

3. CARTESIAN PRODUCT
   Property: The Cartesian product of convex sets is convex
   Formula: If A ⊆ ℝᵐ and B ⊆ ℝⁿ are convex, then A × B ⊆ ℝᵐ⁺ⁿ is convex
   
   Examples:
   • Product of intervals: [a₁,b₁] × [a₂,b₂] = rectangle
   • Product of balls: B₁ × B₂ = cylinder
   • Higher-dimensional product spaces

4. CONVEX HULL
   Property: The convex hull of any set is the smallest convex set containing it
   Formula: conv(S) = {Σᵢ λᵢxᵢ | xᵢ ∈ S, λᵢ ≥ 0, Σᵢ λᵢ = 1}
   
   Examples:
   • Convex hull of finite points forms a polytope
   • Convex hull of circles forms a shape with curved and straight boundaries

5. MINKOWSKI SUM
   Property: The Minkowski sum of convex sets is convex
   Formula: A ⊕ B = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}
   
   Examples:
   • Sum of two balls is a larger ball
   • Sum of polytopes is a polytope

6. PERSPECTIVE FUNCTION

   Definition:
   The perspective function P : ℝⁿ⁺¹ → ℝⁿ is defined as:

      P(x, t) = x/t

   where the domain is dom(P) = {(x, t) | t > 0}.

   The perspective function divides the first n elements of a vector by its last 
   component, effectively scaling or normalizing vectors so the last component 
   becomes one, then dropping the last component.

   Convexity Preservation Property:

   Forward Transformation (Image):
   If S ⊆ dom(P) ⊆ ℝⁿ⁺¹ is convex, then the image P(S) = {P(z) | z ∈ S} is convex.

   Inverse Transformation (Preimage):
   If T ⊆ ℝⁿ is convex, then the preimage P⁻¹(T) = {(x, t) | t > 0, x/t ∈ T} is 
   also convex.

   Proof Sketch:
   The convexity preservation follows from the perspective function's 
   linear-fractional nature. For any y₁, y₂ ∈ P(S) where y₁ = x₁/t₁ and 
   y₂ = x₂/t₂, and for any α ∈ [0,1], the convex combination αy₁ + (1-α)y₂ can 
   be shown to lie in P(S) due to the convexity of S.

   Examples and Applications:

   Geometric Interpretation:
   The perspective function can be thought of as perspective projection onto the 
   hyperplane consisting of all points with last coordinate equal to 1. For any 
   fixed z, P maps all points of the form t(z,1), (t > 0) to z, which form a ray 
   emanating from the origin.

   In Optimization:
   Perspective functions are extensively used in mixed integer nonlinear 
   programming (MINLP) to generate tight, tractable relaxations. They are 
   particularly applicable when binary indicator variables force continuous 
   decision variables to take the value 0 or belong to a convex set.

7. LINEAR-FRACTIONAL FUNCTION
   Definition:
   A linear-fractional function f : ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ is defined as:

      f(x) = (Ax + b)/(cᵀx + d)

   where:
   - A ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ, b ∈ ℝᵐ, c ∈ ℝⁿ, d ∈ ℝ
   - Domain: dom(f) = {x | cᵀx + d > 0}

   Relationship to Perspective Function:
   A linear-fractional function is the composition of a perspective function with 
   an affine function. Specifically, if g : ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ⁺¹ is affine:

      g(x) = [A/cᵀ]x + [b/d]

   and P : ℝᵐ⁺¹ → ℝᵐ is the perspective map, then f = P ∘ g.

   Convexity Preservation Property:

   Forward Transformation:
   If S ⊆ dom(f) ⊆ ℝⁿ is convex, then the image f(S) = P(g(S)) is convex.

   Inverse Transformation:
   If T ⊆ ℝᵐ is convex, then the preimage f⁻¹(T) = g⁻¹(P⁻¹(T)) is convex.

   Mathematical Foundation:
   The convexity preservation follows from the composition of convexity-preserving 
   operations:
   1. Affine transformations preserve convexity
   2. Perspective functions preserve convexity
   3. The composition of convexity-preserving operations preserves convexity

   Examples:

   Simple Linear-Fractional Function:
      f(x) = 1/(x₁ + x₂ + 1)

   This maps convex sets to convex sets in the transformed space.

   Quasiconvexity Property:
   Linear-fractional functions of the form f(x) = (aᵀx + b)/(cᵀx + d) are 
   quasilinear (both quasiconvex and quasiconcave) on their domain.

   Special Cases:
   - When c = 0, the function reduces to an affine function: f(x) = (Ax + b)/d
   - In complex analysis, linear fractional transformations (Möbius 
   transformations) have the form f(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d) where ad - bc ≠ 0

   Applications:

   Optimization:
   Linear-fractional functions commonly appear in:
   - Fractional programming problems
   - Portfolio optimization with risk measures
   - Engineering design problems with efficiency ratios

   Geometric Transformations:
   In projective geometry, linear-fractional transformations preserve certain 
   geometric properties while maintaining convexity of sets under appropriate 
   conditions.

================================================================================

1. NONNEGATIVE WEIGHTED SUM
   Property: Linear combinations with nonnegative coefficients preserve convexity

   • f(x) = |Ax - b| (absolute value of affine function)

   Extended: f(x) = sup{g(x,y) | y ∈ Y} is convex if g(x,y) is convex in x for each y
   
   Examples:
   • f(x) = max{x, -x} = |x| (absolute value)
   • f(x) = max{0, x} (positive part function)
   • f(x) = max{aᵢᵀx + bᵢ | i = 1,...,m} (maximum of affine functions)
   • Support function: Sᴄ(x) = sup{yᵀx | y ∈ C}

4. COMPOSITION RULES (SCALAR CASE)
   Property: Certain compositions preserve convexity
   
   Case 1: If g is convex and h is convex and nondecreasing, then h(g(x)) is convex
   Case 2: If g is concave and h is convex and nonincreasing, then h(g(x)) is convex
   
   Examples:
   • f(x) = exp(g(x)) where g(x) is convex (exponential is convex and increasing)
   • f(x) = (g(x))² where g(x) is convex (square is convex and increasing on ℝ₊)

5. PARTIAL MINIMIZATION

   Formula: If f(x,y) is convex in (x,y) and C is convex, then
   g(x) = inf{f(x,y) | y ∈ C} is convex
   
   Examples:
   • Distance to convex set: dist(x,S) = inf{||x-y|| | y ∈ S}
   • Optimal value function in convex optimization
   • f(x) = inf{y | (x,y) ∈ epi(h)} where h is convex
   • Legendre-Fenchel conjugate: f*(y) = sup{yᵀx - f(x) | x ∈ dom f}

6. PERSPECTIVE FUNCTION
   Property: The perspective of a convex function is convex
   Formula: If f: ℝⁿ → ℝ is convex, then g(x,t) = tf(x/t) is convex on 
   {(x,t) | x/t ∈ dom f, t > 0}
   
   Examples:
   • If f(x) = xᵀx, then g(x,t) = xᵀx/t is convex for t > 0
   • If f(x) = ||x||, then g(x,t) = t||x/t|| = ||x|| for t > 0
   • Perspective of quadratic forms
   • Perspective of entropy functions

7. INTEGRAL AND INFINITE SUM
   Property: Integration and infinite summation preserve convexity
   
   Integral: If f(x,α) is convex in x for each α ∈ A, then
   g(x) = ∫ f(x,α) dμ(α) is convex
   
   Infinite sum: If fᵢ(x) is convex for each i and Σᵢ fᵢ(x) converges, then
   g(x) = Σᵢ fᵢ(x) is convex
   
   Examples:
   • Expected value: E[f(x,ξ)] where f(x,ξ) is convex in x

   • Continuous mixtures of convex functions

8. VECTOR COMPOSITION RULES
