Exercise 2:

Given two collections of integers, one as a set and the other as a frozenset
    mutable_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    immutable_frozenset = frozenset([3, 4, 5, 6])

Q1: Add an element to the set.
Q2: Remove an element from the set.
Q3: Find the union of the set and frozenset.
Q4: Find the intersection of the set and frozenset.
Q5: Find the difference between the set and frozenset.
Q6: Check if the frozenset is a subset of the set.
Q7: Check if the set is disjoint with the frozenset.
