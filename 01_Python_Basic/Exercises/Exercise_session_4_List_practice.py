Exercise 1: numeric List

1. Create a list of student scores with 20 numeric values:
   scores = [78, 85, 92, 88, 76, 95, 89, 90, 85, 92, 84, 79, 88, 91, 87, 93, 85, 90, 94, 88]

2. Access and print the first, middle (index 10), and last scores using indexing.

3. Update the 5th score (index 4) to 80.

4. Use list methods to:
   - Count how many times the score 85 appears.
   - Find the index of the first occurrence of 92.
   - Insert a new score 86 at the 7th position (index 6).
   - Append a score 97 at the end.
   - Extend the list with [82, 84, 88].
   - Remove the first occurrence of 79.
   - Pop the last score and print it.
   - Create a copy of the list and clear the original list.

5. Sort the copied list in descending order and then reverse it.

6. Concatenate the copied list with [75, 77, 79] and multiply the result by 2.

7. Use a loop to print all scores in the final list.

8. Create a 2D list representing scores of 4 students in 5 subjects (you can slice the list accordingly) and print it.

9. Use list comprehension to create a list of scores increased by 10%.

10. Calculate the average, maximum, minimum, and sum of the scores using aggregate functions.

11. Use map() and list comprehension to create a list of boolean values indicating if each score is above 90.

Exercise 2: string list

1. Create a list of items:
   items = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "banana", "grape"]

2. Access and print the second item.

3. Update the last item to "mango".

4. Use list methods to:
   - Count how many times "banana" appears.
   - Find the index of "orange".
   - Insert "kiwi" at the beginning.
   - Append "pear".
   - Extend the list with ["peach", "plum"].
   - Remove the first "banana".
   - Pop the item at index 3 and print it.
   - Copy the list and clear the original.

5. Sort the copied list alphabetically and then reverse it.

6. Concatenate the copied list with ["cherry"] and multiply by 3.

7. Use a loop to print all items.

8. Create a 2D list representing inventory counts for 2 stores and print it.
   Example:
   store_counts = [
       [10, 5, 7],  # Store 1 counts for 3 items
       [8, 12, 6]   # Store 2 counts for same 3 items
   ]

9. Use list comprehension to create a list of item name lengths.

10. Calculate the total number of items using aggregate functions.

11. Use map() and list comprehension to create a list indicating if each item name contains the letter 'a'.
