Immanuel Kant's Principle of Universalizability:

"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

This principle states that before acting, you should consider whether the rule guiding your action could be applied universally, to everyone, without contradiction. 
If the action cannot be universalized without causing a contradiction or harm, then it is immoral.
